# M-Non-attacking-queens-on-an-N-triangle
This program arranges M amount of queens in an N sized triangle board so they would be non-attacking (Bruteforce and Efficient methods included)

Old school project that I did by myself.
There are only 2 methods to solve this problem efficiently without relying on bruteforcing which is 
finding the correct diagonals or finding correct columns as stated in https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~pcp/nonattacking_queens.pdf

Primary functions ( Prints triangle board, solve with bruteforce, solve with efficient column method ).
